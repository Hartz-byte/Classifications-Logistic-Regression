# Iris Flower Classification with Logistic Regression

This repository showcases the classic **Iris flower classification** problem using **Logistic Regression**. It includes two approaches:

1. **Scikit-learn-based Implementation** (with visualizations and decision boundary)
2. **From-scratch Implementation** (manual logistic regression without any ML libraries)

## About the Dataset

The [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) is one of the most famous datasets in machine learning and statistics. It consists of 150 samples of iris flowers with the following features:

- **Sepal Length** (cm)
- **Sepal Width** (cm)
- **Petal Length** (cm)
- **Petal Width** (cm)
- **Target Classes**:
  - `0`: Setosa
  - `1`: Versicolor
  - `2`: Virginica
